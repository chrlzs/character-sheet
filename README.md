## Usage

### Managing Character Sheets

To use this repository for managing your character sheets, follow these steps:

1. Create a new XML file for each character using the provided [XML Schema Document](./character_sheet.xsd) as a guide.
2. Save each character sheet with a descriptive name (e.g., `aragorn_ranger.xml`).
3. Organize your character sheets within the repository as needed.

### Integrating with Your Project

If you're a developer and want to integrate this character sheet format into your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the [XML Schema Document](./character_sheet.xsd) in your project for validation.
2. Parse character sheets in XML format using your preferred programming language.
3. Extract and use character information as needed within your application.

## XML Schema

The character sheet XML schema defines the structure for storing character information. Refer to the [XML Schema Document](./character_sheet.xsd) for details.

## Sample Character Sheet

Here's a sample character sheet in XML format:

```xml
<!-- SampleCharacter.xml -->

<characterSheet>
  <characterName>Aragorn</characterName>
  <characterClass>Ranger</characterClass>
  <characterRace>Human</characterRace>
  
  <stats>
    <strength>18</strength>
    <dexterity>16</dexterity>
    <constitution>14</constitution>
    <intelligence>12</intelligence>
    <wisdom>16</wisdom>
    <charisma>14</charisma>
  </stats>

</characterSheet>
```

Feel free to customize this template to create your character instances.
